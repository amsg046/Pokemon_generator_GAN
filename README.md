# Pokemon_generator_GAN: Project Overview
* Implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) with the objective of generating new Pokemon concept characters from an existing dataset 
* Used PyTorch along with supporting packages / methods in order to implement discriminator and generator neural networks inspired by existing research and implementation from similar applications
* Performed analysis of discriminator and generator neural networks in order to tune hyperparmeters for optimal performance
